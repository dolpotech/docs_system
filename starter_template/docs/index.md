1. Install <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/" target="_blank">Material for MkDocs</a>.

        === "Reproduction of issue"
            If you have already installed <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/" target="_blank">mkdocs</a> and then you install material-mkdocs, you might face an issue on installing `mkdocs-material extensions`.
            See [this issue](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/1450#issuecomment-583397522) on github.
            
        === "Approach for resolution"
            - Uninstall mkdocs.
            - Install material-mkdocs.
            
                !!! info 
                    Material mkdocs-mkdocs already includes the mkdocs package. So no need to install mkdocs separately.

    
2. Download the [Starter Template]() and extract it. Rename it according to the project relevance.                
3. Goto the starter template you just extracted and run `mkdocs serve`.
4. Start preparing awesome documentations!
